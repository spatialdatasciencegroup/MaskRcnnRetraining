This contains a running example of retraining MaskRCNN on a "[Road Barriers](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10L-YCj88Z7RIraDdgCMoCgSH-pAHYLcL?usp=sharing)" dataset.

To run the notebook...

1. Download the road barriers dataset and place it in your Google Drive
2. Load the dataset in the notebook from your Google Drive
    * Note that you may have to change the **base_path** variable in the notebook in order to point it to where the dataset is stored in your directory
    * Example: `base_path = 'gdrive/My Drive/object-detection-research/road-block-images'`
